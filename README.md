# ArmaShell

## Overview
ArmaShell is a simple UNIX shell implementation written in C, providing users with a command-line interface to interact with the operating system. ArmaShell includes built-in commands and supports the execution of external programs.

## Code Structure
The ArmaShell code is organized into various functions, each serving a specific purpose. Below are key functions:

- **Parser Function:** Processes user-entered commands, parsing them into an array of arguments. The maximum allowed arguments in the terminal is limited to 10.

- **Handler Function:** Manages SIGCHLD signals generated by child processes upon termination. Handles the removal of the initiating process from the processes table and reaps zombie processes.

- **cd_command Function:** A built-in command for navigating between directories. Users can move to the home directory, ascend one level, or return to the previous directory.

- **export_command Function:** A built-in command for defining environment variables and using them in child processes.

- **echo_command Function:** A built-in command for displaying the input line as a text string or the value of a specified environment variable.

- **Main Function:** Manages user input, parses commands, and executes them. Also oversees the execution of built-in commands.

## Usage
To use ArmaShell, follow these steps:

1. Compile the provided C code.
2. Run the executable to launch the shell.
3. Utilize the command-line interface to interact with the operating system.
4. Explore and use built-in commands for tasks such as directory navigation and environment variable management.
